### Version 6.16.18  Dec 30, 2025

- **TypeScript compile fixes for ARC3 Spoiler + SnakeBench service** (Author: Cascade)
  - Annotated all callback parameters in `Arc3GameSpoiler.tsx` so `noImplicitAny` stays satisfied.
  - Corrected `frameUnpacker.ts` predicate signature to align with the union it narrows.
  - Patched `snakeBench.ts` to use the right shared-type import paths, new `MODELS` helper, and a typed OpenRouter allowlist Set.
  - Extended `GameIndexEntry` with optional camelCase properties for legacy rows so filename lookups stay typed.
  - Result: `npm run check` now passes with zero TypeScript errors.

### Version 6.16.11  Dec 30, 2025

- **DRY: Consolidate Specialized Formatters to Shared Utilities** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4.5)
  - **New Shared Formatters**:
    - Added `formatCostSmart()` to `shared/utils/formatters.ts` - Smart unit conversion for very small costs (millicents/cents/dollars)
    - Added `formatUsdLocale()` to `shared/utils/formatters.ts` - Locale-aware Intl.NumberFormat currency formatting
    - Both include comprehensive JSDoc with examples and parameter descriptions
  - **Eliminated Duplicate Code**:
    - Removed local `formatCost` from `ModelComparisonPage.tsx:380-391` (12 lines) → replaced with `formatCostSmart` (2 call sites)
    - Removed local `formatUsdPerM` from `AdminOpenRouter.tsx:105-113` (9 lines) → replaced with `formatUsdLocale` (4 call sites)
  - **Behavior Improvements**:
    - AdminOpenRouter now shows 'N/A' instead of null for missing pricing (consistent with shared formatter pattern)
    - Updated conditional checks from `!value` to `value === 'N/A'` for explicit null handling
  - **Intentionally Kept Local**:
    - Simple 2-4 decimal formatters in BeetreeSolver, Leaderboards, PoetiqSolver remain local (context-specific variations)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `shared/utils/formatters.ts` (added formatCostSmart, formatUsdLocale with JSDoc)
    - `client/src/pages/ModelComparisonPage.tsx:27,380-391,712,716` (import shared formatter, remove local, update usages)
    - `client/src/pages/AdminOpenRouter.tsx:18,106-113,107-109,112-113,119-121,124-125` (import shared formatter, remove local, update conditional checks)
  - **Impact**: Reduced formatter duplication, centralized specialized logic, maintained backward compatibility

### Version 6.16.10  Dec 30, 2025

- **Build Fix: Resolved Missing Import Path for Shared Formatters** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4.5)

    - Added missing shadcn/ui component imports (Card, Button, Separator, Accordion, Table, Badge)
    - Added missing TypeScript interface `WormArenaModelInsightsReportProps`
  - **Root Cause**:
    - Previous assistant moved formatters to shared folder but failed to update import path in component
    - Missing component imports and type definition prevented build from completing
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/wormArena/WormArenaModelInsightsReport.tsx` (fixed import paths, added missing imports and types)
  - **Impact**: Production build now succeeds, resolving deployment blocker to staging environment

### Version 6.16.9  Dec 29, 2025

- **Code Quality: Fixed Critical Maintainability Issues in Worm Arena Refactor** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4.5)
  - **Critical Bug Fixes**:
    - Fixed catch block bug in `WormArenaReportService.ts:60-66` that was injecting duplicate performance metrics into markdown output instead of handling JSON parse errors properly.
    - Removed excessive `as any` type assertions - reduced from double-cast `(as any) as any` to single cast with explanatory comments.
    - Fixed parse-and-discard logic in `requestInsightsSummary` - removed pointless JSON.parse that validated then discarded the result.
  - **DRY Improvements**:
    - Created `SQL_TRUESKILL_EXPOSED()` helper in `snakebenchSqlHelpers.ts` to consolidate TrueSkill formula `COALESCE(trueskill_exposed, trueskill_mu - 3 * trueskill_sigma)`.
    - Updated `AnalyticsRepository.ts` and `LeaderboardRepository.ts` to use shared helper, eliminating formula duplication.

    - Integrated leaderboard rank and total model count into model insights reports.
  - **UI/UX Polish**:
    - Updated `WormArenaModelInsightsReport.tsx` to display 'Rank X of Y' in summary tiles.
    - Integrated full score distribution (avg, p25, p50, p75) into the Cost and Efficiency section.
    - Cleaned up stale local formatting helpers in favor of centralized `shared/utils/formatters.ts`.
    - Switched UI to use `formatUsd` for currency consistency.
  - **Code Quality**:
    - Consolidated streaming report finalization in `WormArenaReportService.ts` to use `buildReportObject` as a single source of truth.

  - **Files Modified**: `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts`, `server/repositories/AnalyticsRepository.ts`

### Version 6.16.6  Dec 29, 2025

- **Worm Arena Model Insights: Streaming fixes, loading state, and UI polish** (Author: Claude Code using Haiku)
  - **Streaming Foundation**:
    - Fixed critical event routing bug in `snakeBenchService.ts` where `emitEvent` callback was ignoring event type and routing all events to `onStatus` handler, causing SSE stream mismanagement and premature connection closure.
    - Corrected callback to properly route `'stream.status'` and `'stream.chunk'` events to appropriate handlers.
  - **Frontend UX Improvements**:
    - Added immediate loading spinner ("Preparing analysis...") that displays during the `'requested'` state, before first OpenAI stream events arrive, providing instant visual feedback to users.
    - Expanded all accordion sections by default (Failure Modes, Cost & Efficiency, Opponent Pain Points, Data Quality) for better content discoverability.
    - Increased section heading sizes from `text-sm` to `text-base` with bold weight for better visual hierarchy.
    - Redesigned Data Quality badges as minimal, colorful pill-shaped elements with vibrant background colors (green for loss coverage, red for unknowns, orange for early losses) and improved spacing.
  - **Content Clarity**:
    - Removed confusing "Generated by [model]" attribution lines that conflicted with the meta-feature nature of the insights.
  - **Meta Feature Note**: This is a very cool meta feature—LLMs play Snake games, then a different LLM analyzes how those LLMs played. The streaming insights report showcases this self-reflective AI analysis pipeline.
  - **Files Modified**: `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts`, `client/src/components/wormArena/WormArenaModelInsightsReport.tsx`

### Version 6.16.5  Dec 29, 2025

- **Fix: Worm Arena Model Insights report generation and streaming** (Author: Claude Code using Haiku)

  - Report generation now resilient to LLM summary API failures

### Version 6.16.4  Dec 28, 2025

- **Fix: Robust Model Aggregation & Visibility Restoration** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Purpose**: Fix empty model list on Worm Arena Models page caused by overly restrictive SQL filtering and grouping issues.
  - **Issues Fixed**:
    - Restored visibility of models by removing the restrictive `g.status = 'completed'` filter from `GameReadRepository.ts`.
    - Implemented a more robust "Hybrid Aggregation" approach: SQL handles initial grouping by name/slug to ensure results return, while JavaScript handles final deduplication and stat aggregation by normalized slug.
    - This hybrid approach solves the `model-item-undefined` React warning without the risk of empty results from complex SQL `MAX()` aggregations on join-heavy tables.
    - Preserved URL persistence and auto-selection logic for a seamless "Combat Dossier" experience.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/repositories/GameReadRepository.ts` (Implemented JS-side aggregation and removed status filter)
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaModels.tsx` (Final logic verification and cleanup)
  - **Impact**: All models with played games are now correctly visible, and the page is resilient to database inconsistencies like model renames.

### Version 6.16.3  Dec 28, 2025

- **Fix: Worm Arena Models page display and navigation completeness** (Author: Claude Haiku 4.5)
  - **Purpose**: Fix broken model name display in Worm Arena Models page and ensure all Worm Arena subitems are accessible from main navigation.
  - **Issues Fixed**:
    - Fixed SelectItem structure in WormArenaModels.tsx that caused malformed dropdown display ("Choose a model_openai/gpt-5-nano" concatenation bug).
    - Added missing `modelName` field to `WormArenaModelWithGames` type for proper display names.
    - Updated backend SQL query to fetch `models.name` field for model name display.
    - Corrected page label from "Select Combatant" to "Select Model".
    - Updated navigation to include all 8 Worm Arena pages under SnakeBench dropdown (was missing Models, Skill Analysis, Distributions, Rules).
    - Updated Stats page navigation title to "Worm Arena (Stats & Placement)" for accuracy.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaModels.tsx` (fixed SelectItem structure, corrected label, added modelName display)
    - `client/src/components/layout/AppNavigation.tsx` (added 4 missing Worm Arena pages to dropdown menu)
    - `server/repositories/GameReadRepository.ts` (added `m.name` to SQL query and result mapping)
    - `shared/types.ts` (added `modelName: string` to `WormArenaModelWithGames` interface)
  - **Impact**: Worm Arena Models page now renders correctly with friendly model names, and full navigation suite is accessible from main menu.

### Version 6.16.1  Dec 27, 2025

- **Insights: Comprehensive local game analysis and record-breaking matches** (Author: Gemini 3 Flash High)
  - **Purpose**: Deep-dive into local SnakeBench history to extract performance records and fix directory blindness in the UI.
  - **Local Records Found**:
    - Discovered **30-apple record** (104 rounds) by `openai/gpt-5.1-codex-mini` vs `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free`.
    - Promoted top local matches to the "Greatest Hits" Hall of Fame.
  - **Tooling Enhancements**:
    - Upgraded `analyze_local_games.py` with CSV/Markdown reporting, model/winner extraction, and date-range filtering.
    - Generated `docs/local-game-insights-dec-2025.md` with architectural recommendations for the frontend stats engine.
  - **Backend Fixes**:
    - Fixed `SnakeBenchReplayResolver` to scan both `completed_games` and `completed_games_local`, resolving missing replay links in the UI.
    - Fixed broken relative import paths across 7 SnakeBench services (`shared/types.js` level traversal).
    - Aligned `SnakeBenchLlmPlayerPromptTemplate.ts` with new Python source (added web search prohibition).
  - **Author Updates**: Refreshed headers in 8 files to reflect **Gemini 3 Flash High** authorship.
  - **Files Created**:
    - `docs/local-game-insights-dec-2025.md`
    - `external/SnakeBench/local_game_analysis_dec_2025.csv`

### Version 6.16.0  Dec 27, 2025

- **Architecture: Modularize Arc3Games into per-game files for 100+ game scalability** (Author: Claude Haiku 4.5)
  - **Purpose**: Transform monolithic `shared/arc3Games.ts` (383 lines) into modular, extensible architecture where each game has its own self-contained file. Designed to scale to 100+ games with zero merge conflicts.
  - **Problem Solved**: Monolithic file caused merge conflicts, unclear ownership, poor scalability. Adding game #100 required editing central file.
  - **Solution**: Per-game files with central registry maintaining backward compatibility.
  - **Architecture Changes**:
    - Extracted all TypeScript interfaces to `shared/arc3Games/types.ts`
    - Created per-game files: `ls20.ts`, `as66.ts`, `ft09.ts`, `lp85.ts`, `sp80.ts`, `vc33.ts`
    - Central registry in `shared/arc3Games/index.ts` (maintains 100% backward compatibility)
    - Deleted original monolithic file
  - **New Features**:
    - Added `'replay'` type to `GameResource` interface for expert playthroughs
    - Added Zanthous grandmaster replays:
      - **LP85**: 92 moves completion (https://three.arcprize.org/replay/lp85-d265526edbaa/dcae645c-3fec-4388-b805-7427f8cdb318)
      - **AS66**: 415 moves completion (https://three.arcprize.org/replay/as66-821a4dcad9c2/515e3de3-0b2a-4199-b268-4b1f84d75e10)
  - **UI Enhancements**:
    - Updated `Arc3GameSpoiler.tsx` with new "Notable Playthroughs" section
    - Replays displayed separately from general resources with gradient background styling
    - Replays get visual prominence to highlight expert gameplay
  - **Documentation**:
    - Added `docs/arc3-game-analysis/ls20-analysis.md` - detailed frame-by-frame analysis of LS20 grid patterns and mechanics
    - LS20 game page now includes analysis resource link
  - **Backward Compatibility**: 100% maintained - all existing imports work unchanged
  - **Future Extensibility**: Adding game #100 requires only:
    1. Create `shared/arc3Games/game100.ts`
    2. Add 1 import line in `shared/arc3Games/index.ts`
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/Arc3GameSpoiler.tsx` (+Notable Playthroughs section, +replay filtering)
    - `shared/arc3Games/` (new directory with 8 files: types, index, 6 games)
    - `docs/arc3-game-analysis/` (new analysis documentation)
  - **Files Deleted**:
    - `shared/arc3Games.ts` (monolithic file replaced by directory structure)
  - **Build Status**: No errors, full production build succeeds

### Version 6.15.0  Dec 27, 2025

- **Architectural Refactor: Monolithic SnakeBench Repository Split** (Author: Gemini 3 Flash High)
  - **Purpose**: Refactored the 2.5k-line monolithic `SnakeBenchRepository.ts` into six focused modules to improve SRP (Single Responsibility Principle), testability, and maintainability.
  - **Terminology Clarification**: Explicitly documented that "Game" and "Match" are used interchangeably across the codebase (DB vs. Frontend) and preserved this parity for compatibility.
  - **External Compatibility**: Maintained 100% compatibility with the original `SnakeBench` database schema and JSON structures.
  - **Key Modules Created**:
    1. `GameWriteRepository.ts`: Handles match recording, replay ingestion, and rating updates (TrueSkill/Elo).
    2. `GameReadRepository.ts`: Handles match search, recent games, global stats, and model history.
    3. `LeaderboardRepository.ts`: Handles TrueSkill/Elo leaderboards and pairing history.
    4. `CurationRepository.ts`: Handles "Greatest Hits" multi-dimension logic.
    5. `AnalyticsRepository.ts`: Handles model insights data and run-length distributions.
    6. `snakebenchSqlHelpers.ts`: Centralizes shared SQL fragments, constants (TrueSkill/Elo), and utility functions.
  - **Integration Changes**:
    - Updated `RepositoryService` to manage the new repository instances and removed the deprecated monolithic reference.
    - Updated `SnakeBenchService`, `SnakeBenchIngestQueue`, `ReplayResolver`, and other consumers to use domain-specific repositories.
    - Updated `adminController` and `backfill` scripts to use split write/read paths.
  - **Maintenance**: Cleaned up the `docs/` folder by moving older implementation plans to `docs/oldPlans/`.
  - **Files Removed**:
    - `server/repositories/SnakeBenchRepository.ts` (Legacy monolith deleted)
  - **Files Created**:
    - `server/repositories/GameWriteRepository.ts`
    - `server/repositories/GameReadRepository.ts`
    - `server/repositories/LeaderboardRepository.ts`
    - `server/repositories/CurationRepository.ts`

### Version 6.14.0  Dec 27, 2025

- **Data Quality: Exclude invalid zero-round games from all Worm Arena statistics** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Problem**: Games with `rounds = 0` are invalid (failed to start or errored immediately) and were polluting statistics, causing "Most Common: Round 0" in distributions and skewing leaderboards.
  - **Solution**: Added `COALESCE(g.rounds, 0) > 0` filter to all SQL queries that aggregate completed games.
  - **Affected queries** (all in `SnakeBenchRepository.ts`):
    1. `searchMatches` - match search results
    2. `getWormArenaGreatestHits` - duration query
    3. `getPairingHistory` - matchup suggestions
    4. `getBasicLeaderboard` - both winRate and gamesPlayed sorts
    5. `getModelsWithGames` - TrueSkill leaderboard data
    6. `getModelMatchHistoryUnbounded` - per-model match history
    7. `getModelInsightsData` - summary, failure modes, and opponent queries
    8. `getRunLengthDistribution` - game length distribution chart
  - **Impact**: All Worm Arena pages now show accurate statistics excluding invalid matches.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/repositories/SnakeBenchRepository.ts` - Added round > 0 filter to 12 SQL queries

- **Simplify: Worm Arena Run Length Chart shows all models by default** (Author: Cascade)

  - Header comment refreshed to match new behavior.

### Version 6.13.3  Dec 27, 2025

- **Refactor: Worm Arena Models Page - Modular Sortable Match History** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4)
  - **Purpose**: Remove redundant WormArenaRecentMatches component; create reusable sortable match history table
  - **Changes**:
    1. **Removed**: `WormArenaRecentMatches` from Models page - was duplicating Match History with inferior layout
    2. **Created**: `WormArenaMatchHistoryTable` - new modular, reusable component with rich metrics
    3. **Added sorting**: All columns sortable (Opponent, Date, Duration, Outcome, Score, Rounds, Cost)
    4. **Sortable headers**: Click column headers to sort asc/desc with visual indicators
  - **Component Features** (`WormArenaMatchHistoryTable`):
    - Accepts `history`, `modelSlug`, `isLoading`, `error`, `onOpponentClick` props
    - Optional `showCard` prop to render with/without Card wrapper
    - Clickable opponents to switch model selection
    - Default sort: Date descending (most recent first)
  - **Files Created**:
    - `client/src/components/wormArena/WormArenaMatchHistoryTable.tsx` - Modular sortable table
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaModels.tsx` - Removed inline table, uses new component
  - **Note**: `WormArenaRecentMatches.tsx` still exists but is no longer used on Models page

- **Planning: SnakeBench repository split migration map & test coverage** (Author: Cascade)
  - Added detailed migration map for breaking `SnakeBenchRepository` into GameWrite/GameRead/Leaderboard/Curation/Analytics repos plus shared SQL helpers.
  - Documented helper inventory (slug normalization, limit clamps, date parsing, common WHERE fragments, replay path resolution).
  - Defined unit, golden, and integration test fixtures (parseReplayJson edge cases, TrueSkill/Elo goldens, search/leaderboard/greatest-hits/insights/run-length matrices).
  - Outlined wiring/rollout, backfill/recompute, and rollback plans; listed expected file impacts.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `docs/2025-12-27-snakebench-repo-refactor-plan.md`

### Version 6.13.2  Dec 27, 2025

- **Fix & Enhancement: Worm Arena Run Length Distribution Chart** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4)
  - **Purpose**: Fix histogram not rendering due to chart design issues; add model selection and summary statistics
  - **Root Cause**: Original chart tried to show all 44 models with 88 bar series (wins+losses each), making bars invisibly thin. Also used per-model stackId which created grouped bars instead of proper stacked histogram.
  - **Fixes**:
    1. **Chart rendering**: Switched from ChartContainer wrapper to direct Recharts ResponsiveContainer to avoid height conflicts
    2. **Proper stacking**: Changed to single `stackId="stack"` so all bars stack together correctly
    3. **Model limiting**: Default to top 5 models (max 8) to prevent bar overcrowding
  - **New Features**:
    1. **Model selection UI**: Collapsible picker with checkboxes to choose which models to visualize
    2. **Quick select buttons**: Top 3, Top 5, Top 8, Clear All for fast model selection
    3. **Summary statistics row**: 6 stat cards showing Models count, Avg Length, Most Common round, Range, Top Win Rate model, Longest Average model
    4. **Distinct color palette**: 8 distinct colors for models with lighter variants for losses
    5. **Improved tooltip**: Shows breakdown per model at each round with color indicators
    6. **Custom legend**: Cleaner display with win/loss color boxes per model
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/wormArena/stats/WormArenaRunLengthChart.tsx` - Complete rewrite with proper stacking and model selection
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaDistributions.tsx` - Added stats row, improved layout with icons, computed statistics
  - **Testing**: Chart now renders correctly with top 5 models visible by default; users can select/deselect models to compare

### Version 6.13.1  Dec 27, 2025

- **Fix: Worm Arena Run Length Distribution page** (Author: Claude Code Haiku 4.5)
  - **Purpose**: Resolve SQL parsing error and low default threshold preventing data display
  - **Issues Fixed**:
    1. SQL query had incorrect JOIN ordering causing "missing FROM-clause entry for table "gp"" error
       - Reorganized FROM clause to start with game_participants (primary data source)
       - Made ORDER BY more explicit using full expressions instead of aliases
    2. Tied games were miscounted as losses in distribution aggregation
       - Now explicitly checks for 'won' vs 'lost' results
       - Tied games excluded from distribution (don't fit binary win/loss model)
    3. Default minimum games threshold was too high (10), preventing data display
       - Lowered default from 10 to 5 games per model
       - Makes page more useful with limited data while still being meaningful
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/repositories/SnakeBenchRepository.ts` - Fixed SQL query structure, result classification, default threshold
    - `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts` - Updated default minGames parameter
    - `client/src/hooks/useWormArenaDistributions.ts` - Updated default minGames parameter
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaDistributions.tsx` - Updated default minGames threshold
  - **Testing**: Distribution page now returns data when models have 5+ completed games


### Version 6.13.0  Dec 27, 2025

- **Feature: Worm Arena Tweet Kit & Share Buttons** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Purpose**: Enable easy sharing of Worm Arena matches to Twitter/X with pre-filled tweet text and replay links.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Added `WormArenaShareButton` component with dropdown options: Share on Twitter/X, Copy tweet text, Copy replay link
    - Tweet text auto-generates from match metadata using smart templates (tie, high score, long/expensive, default)
    - Share button added to Greatest Hits card entries and main replay viewer header
    - CLI script `scripts/worm-arena-tweet-kit.ts` for batch tweet generation with optional MP4 video creation
    - Script fetches greatest hits, downloads replays if needed, generates tweet blurbs, and outputs to `tmp/tweet-kit/`
    - npm script: `npm run worm:tweets -- --limit 5 [--video]`
  - **Files Created**:
    - `client/src/components/WormArenaShareButton.tsx` - Reusable share button component
    - `scripts/worm-arena-tweet-kit.ts` - CLI tool for batch tweet generation
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/WormArenaGreatestHits.tsx` - Added share buttons to game entries
    - `client/src/pages/WormArena.tsx` - Added share button to match header
    - `package.json` - Added `worm:tweets` npm script

### Version 6.12.3  Dec 27, 2025

- **Feature: Greatest Hits include monster apple hauls** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Purpose**: Surface memorable matches where a single player collected 25+ apples.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Added apples-haul leaderboard dimension (25+ apples by any player) to greatest-hits query and highlight messaging.
    - Greatest Hits card copy now mentions monster apple hauls.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/repositories/SnakeBenchRepository.ts`
    - `client/src/components/WormArenaGreatestHits.tsx`

### Version 6.12.2  Dec 27, 2025

- **Fix: Worm Arena live status strip correctness & UX** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Purpose**: Make live streaming status readable and accurate: apples, alive list, timers, names, and session copying.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Added copy-to-clipboard button for session ID; keeps layout tidy with truncation and spacing.
    - Alive/scores duplicated data removed from the strip; strip now focuses on round, wall clock, since-last-move, phase, and session copy.
    - Alive list still derives from live alive-map (with fallbacks) and scores parse from frames/status text for other components (scoreboard).
    - Wall clock and since-last-move timers computed from frame timestamps to populate timing fields (shared with scoreboard).
    - Player rows removed from the strip to prevent overlap; scoreboard holds names/scores.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/WormArenaLiveStatusStrip.tsx`
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaLive.tsx`
    - `client/src/components/WormArenaLiveScoreboard.tsx`

### Version 6.12.1  Dec 27, 2025

- **Feature: Worm Arena Greatest Hits Enhanced Ranking Dimensions** (Author: Claude Code Sonnet 4.5)
  - **Purpose**: Extend greatest-hits ranking with 3 new dimensions (duration, total score, close matches) to surface more types of interesting games.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Added 3 new SQL queries to repository: duration (wall-clock time), total score (combined apples from both players), close matches (score delta ≤ 2, min 5 apples)
    - All 6 queries run in parallel via `Promise.all()` for optimal performance
    - Updated deduplication logic to handle 6 dimensions and assign category-specific highlight reasons
    - New highlight reasons include: "Marathon duration (Xh Ym)", "Epic combined score (X apples)", "Perfect tie", "Photo finish (1 apple difference)", "Neck-and-neck (X apple difference)"
    - Frontend component now displays duration badges ("Duration: 2h 15m") and total score badges ("32 total apples") when data is available
    - Optional fields added to `WormArenaGreatestHitGame` interface: `endedAt`, `sumFinalScores`, `durationSeconds`, `category` (all backward-compatible)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/repositories/SnakeBenchRepository.ts:706-1072` - Added 3 new SQL queries, updated deduplication logic
    - `shared/types.ts:903-921` - Added 4 new optional fields to `WormArenaGreatestHitGame` interface
    - `client/src/components/WormArenaGreatestHits.tsx:150-227` - Added duration and total score badges
    - `server/services/snakeBenchHallOfFame.ts:1-24` - Updated header comment documenting new optional fields
  - **Files Deleted**:
    - `external/SnakeBench/backend/cli/generate_greatest_hits_report.py` - Functionality integrated into database-driven system
  - **Performance Note**: If queries are slow (>200ms), consider adding database indexes:
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_games_duration ON public.games(end_time, start_time) WHERE status = 'completed' AND end_time IS NOT NULL;
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_game_participants_score ON public.game_participants(game_id, score);
    ```

### Version 6.12.0  Dec 27, 2025

- **Feature: ARC3 Auto-Discovered Level Screenshots** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Purpose**: Automatically discover and include PNG level screenshots for ARC-AGI-3 games without manual hardcoding.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Scans `client/public` folder for PNG files matching pattern `{gameId}-lvl{levelNumber}.png` or `{gameId}-lvl{levelNumber}{suffix}.png`
    - Automatically generates level screenshot metadata with proper sorting and variant handling (e.g., `as66-lvl6a.png` becomes "Variant A")
    - Provides new API endpoints: `/api/arc3/metadata/games`, `/api/arc3/metadata/games/:gameId`, `/api/arc3/metadata/games/:gameId/screenshots`
    - Supports all existing games: ls20, as66, ft09, lp85, sp80, vc33
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/services/arc3ScreenshotService.ts` (NEW)
    - `server/routes/arc3.ts` (added metadata endpoints)
    - `shared/arc3Games.ts` (reverted hardcoded arrays to manual entries for now)

### Version 6.11.1  Dec 25, 2025

- **UI: Worm Arena Greatest Hits pinned matches** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Purpose**: Highlight recent standout Worm Arena battles for quick replay access.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Added pinned replays for Grok 4.1 Fast vs GLM 4.7 (24-21, 94 rounds, high cost), GPT-5 Nano vs GPT-5.1 Codex Mini (21-20, 90 rounds), Nemotron 3 Nano vs GPT-5.1 Codex Mini (11-10, 53 rounds), DeepSeek v3.2 vs GPT-5 Nano (15-15 tie, 77 rounds), and Gemini 2.5 Flash vs DeepSeek v3.2 (18-11, 58 rounds).
    - Pinned entries are merged with fetched greatest hits and surface at the top of the list with replay links.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/WormArenaGreatestHits.tsx`

### Version 6.11.0  Dec 25, 2025

- **Feature: BYOK Production Enforcement** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4)
  - **Purpose**: Enforce Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) policy in production - users must provide their own API keys for all paid AI providers.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Production: ALL models require user-provided API keys (no server key fallback)
    - Dev/staging: Existing behavior preserved (server keys allowed as fallback)
  - **Backend Changes**:
    - Created `server/utils/environmentPolicy.ts` - environment detection utility with `requiresUserApiKey()`, `isProduction()`, `isDevelopment()` helpers
    - Updated `poetiqController.ts` - environment-aware BYOK enforcement
    - Updated `snakeBenchController.ts` - production API key requirement for matches
    - Updated `streamController.ts` - production API key requirement for puzzle analysis
  - **Frontend Changes**:
    - Created `client/src/lib/environmentPolicy.ts` - client-side environment detection
    - Updated `client/src/lib/streaming/analysisStream.ts` - added `apiKey` to `AnalysisStreamParams`
    - Updated `client/src/hooks/useAnalysisResults.ts` - pass `apiKey` through to streaming
    - Updated `client/src/pages/PuzzleExaminer.tsx` - added BYOK API key input card (production only)
  - **Security**: User keys are used for session only, never stored persistently

### Version 6.10.13  Dec 25, 2025

- **Fix: Worm Arena Live score display disconnected from streaming data** (Author: Claude Haiku 4.5)
  - **Purpose**: Fix score showing "0" across all UI panels despite correct data in streaming output.
  - **Root Cause**: Snake ID extraction prioritized `playerNameBySnakeId`/`reasoningBySnakeId` (populated from chunks) over `frame.state.scores` (source of truth). When chunk metadata used different keys than frame state, scores failed to resolve.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Prioritize `frame.state.scores` keys as primary source for snake IDs (ensures we extract scores from the correct keys)
    - Move score display from bottom of reasoning panels to header (inline with player name and worm icon)
    - Removed duplicate score section at panel bottom
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaLive.tsx` (snakeIds extraction logic, lines 445-470)
    - `client/src/components/WormArenaReasoning.tsx` (score repositioned to header, removed bottom score panel)

### Version 6.10.12  Dec 25, 2025

- **Fix: GPT-5/o-series models must route directly to OpenAI in Worm Arena** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4)
  - **Purpose**: Fix "OpenRouter response missing output field" error for GPT-5 and o-series models.
  - **Root Cause**: OpenRouter's Responses API proxy returns empty `output=[]` for GPT-5/o-series models. These models require the Responses API which OpenRouter does not properly proxy.
  - **Behavior**: Added `_requires_responses_api()` helper to detect GPT-5/o-series models. Factory now routes these models directly to OpenAI regardless of explicit `provider: openrouter` config. Raises clear error if OPENAI_API_KEY is missing.
  - **Mixed Matchups**: GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini vs Minimax 2.1 now works correctly - each player gets appropriate provider (OpenAI direct vs OpenRouter).
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `external/SnakeBench/backend/llm_providers.py` - Added routing fix and helper function

### Version 6.10.11  Dec 25, 2025

- **Fix: Worm Arena OpenRouter transforms routing** (Author: Codex (GPT-5))
  - **Purpose**: Stop OpenRouter-only `transforms` from breaking OpenAI SDK calls while preserving Worm Arena defaults.
  - **Behavior**: Routes OpenRouter `transforms` via `extra_body`, strips them for OpenAI direct, and documents the Worm Arena integration note.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `external/SnakeBench/backend/llm_providers.py`
    - `external/SnakeBench/README.md`
    - `external/SnakeBench/CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.10.10  Dec 24, 2025

- **UI: Improve grid size label readability on analysis cards** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Purpose**: Keep grid dimension badges and titles legible against warm gradients and dark shells.
  - **Behavior**: Forced black text on puzzle grid titles and size badges with a white badge background and dark border for reliable contrast.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/puzzle/PuzzleGrid.tsx`

### Version 6.10.9  Dec 24, 2025

- **Ops: OpenRouter tournament script for new Seed/GLM/Minimax models** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Purpose**: Queue WormArena matches round-robin among new models and against baselines with optional async and completion logging.
  - **Behavior**: Runs both-direction pairings for seed 1.6 variants, minimax m2.1, glm 4.7, and “oops” slug versus each other and baselines (GPT-5.1 Codex Mini, GPT-5 Mini, GPT-5 Nano, Grok 4.1 Fast, Devstral 2512, DeepSeek v3.2). Adds async job tracking and completion summary.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `scripts/worm-arena-tournaments/run-paid-devstral-matches.ps1`

### Version 6.10.7  Dec 24, 2025

- **Chore: Root cleanup for legacy scripts and media** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Purpose**: Reduce clutter by grouping Johan_Land verification scripts, archival docs, and media blobs into scoped folders.
  - **Work**:
    - Created `scripts/legacy-johan-land/README.md` and relocated all Johan_Land DB check `.mjs` utilities there.
    - Added `docs/archives/` and moved historical docs (AGENTS-OLD.md, oldCLAUDE.md) plus misc temp notes into purpose-built directories.
    - Introduced `media/reference/` and moved multi-GB MP3/MP4 recordings out of the repo root.
  - **Impact**: Root directory now surfaces only actively maintained assets; legacy tooling remains available under a documented folder.

### Version 6.10.6  Dec 24, 2025

- **UI: Dark theme analysis cards and larger Puzzle Analyst typography** (Author: Codex (GPT-5))
  - **Purpose**: Make expanded analysis cards blend into the dark Puzzle Analyst view and improve readability.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Added a dark theme option to `AnalysisResultCard` and applied it within Puzzle Analyst.
    - Added dark theme variants to analysis card subcomponents and feedback sections.
    - Increased header and row font sizes in Puzzle Analyst for easier scanning.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultCard.tsx` - Theme wrapper and dark palette for the card shell.

### Version 6.10.5  Dec 24, 2025

- **Layout: Remove sticky headers and render PNG thumbnails in Puzzle Analyst** (Author: Codex (GPT-5))
  - **Purpose**: Eliminate header overlap while making grid previews smaller, more zoomed out, and consistently rendered on black mats.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Removed sticky header layers so the column header and page header no longer overlay rows.
    - Generated client-side PNG thumbnails with extra padding for a zoomed-out grid preview.
    - Tightened row typography and spacing to keep metadata dense but readable.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/PuzzleAnalyst.tsx` - Removed sticky header logic and tightened column header spacing.
    - `client/src/components/puzzle/ExplanationGridRow.tsx` - Added canvas-based PNG thumbnails and reduced row padding.
    - `docs/2025-12-24-puzzle-analyst-layout-plan.md` - Recorded sticky header removal and PNG thumbnail approach.

### Version 6.10.4  Dec 24, 2025

- **Fix: Restore multi-test grid previews and expected outputs in Puzzle Analyst** (Author: Codex (GPT-5))
  - **Purpose**: Ensure multi-test explanations show stacked previews and expanded cards always include expected outputs with working mismatch toggles.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Added stacked grid previews that fall back to multi-test predictions when single grids are missing.
    - Passed puzzle test cases into `AnalysisResultCard` so expected outputs and mismatch diffs render.
    - Added the missing `multiTestPredictionGrids` type so stacked previews compile cleanly.
    - Tightened padding, clarified token/time labels, and reduced thumbnail size on black backgrounds.
    - Solidified the column header background and moved the grid container closer to the sticky header.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/puzzle/ExplanationGridRow.tsx` - Stacked preview selection and test case wiring for expanded cards.
    - `client/src/pages/PuzzleAnalyst.tsx` - Supplies test cases from puzzle data to each row.
    - `docs/2025-12-24-puzzle-analyst-layout-plan.md` - Documented the multi-test grid handling update.

### Version 6.10.3  Dec 24, 2025

- **Layout: Refresh Puzzle Analyst grid density** (Author: Codex (GPT-5))
  - **Purpose**: Tighten the Puzzle Analyst presentation to match the high-density reference: align column widths, show cost/tokens/latency in a single header, and keep the details tucked behind expandable rows.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Added summary badges to the sticky header so analysts immediately see all/correct/incorrect counts.
    - Rebuilt `ExplanationGridRow` to show the grid thumbnail, model metadata, cost, latency, tokens, and Badges for status/reasoning without overlapping content.
    - Updated column headers and container styling so the grid lines match the row layout and the page keeps a compact, futuristic feel.
    - Adjusted sticky offsets so the Puzzle Analyst header respects the global AppHeader height and does not overlap row content.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `docs/2025-12-24-puzzle-analyst-layout-plan.md` - Documented the layout refresh approach and file responsibilities before coding.
    - `client/src/components/puzzle/ExplanationGridRow.tsx` - Dense metadata header, status badges, tokens/cost formatting, and revised expand region.
    - `client/src/pages/PuzzleAnalyst.tsx` - Sticky header counts, new column widths, and heavier dark styling around the grid container.

### Version 6.10.2  Dec 21, 2025

- **Fix: Handle malformed boolean data in multiplePredictedOutputs field** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Root Cause**: Existing database records contained boolean values for `multiplePredictedOutputs` instead of expected array/object/null
  - **Symptom**: "[WARN][utilities] Unexpected type for multiplePredictedOutputs: boolean" warnings on puzzle explanations API calls
  - **Solution**: Enhanced `safeJsonParse()` in `CommonUtilities.ts` to gracefully handle boolean values by treating them as malformed data and returning null
  - **Impact**: Eliminates warnings and prevents potential crashes when reading legacy malformed data
  - **Backwards Compatible**: System continues functioning normally with existing bad data
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/utils/CommonUtilities.ts` - Added boolean handling in safeJsonParse function
  - **Prevention**: Future writes now properly sanitize boolean values in explanationService.ts

### Version 6.10.1  Dec 21, 2025

    - `client/src/pages/ModelDebate.tsx` - "Generate First Explanation" navigation
    - `client/src/pages/PuzzleDiscussion.tsx` - Multiple navigation links (2 locations)
    - `client/src/pages/FeedbackExplorer.tsx` - Puzzle and explanation navigation links (2 locations)
    - `client/src/components/puzzle/AnalysisResultHeader.tsx` - Copy link share feature
  - **Impact**: All internal navigation now consistently uses /task/ routes, completing the migration

### Version 6.10.0  Dec 21, 2025

- **Feature: Puzzle Analyst - New high-density grid page for analyzing explanations** (Author: Claude Code using Haiku 4.5)
  - **Purpose**: Read-only, analysis-focused interface for browsing and comparing hundreds of AI-generated explanations for a single puzzle
  - **Design**: Dark futuristic theme with high-information-density grid layout (contrasts with warm PuzzleExaminer)
  - **Behavior**:
    - Default puzzle navigation now routes to `/task/:taskId` (Puzzle Analyst) instead of `/puzzle/:taskId` (PuzzleExaminer)
    - Shows all explanations for a puzzle in compact rows with: predicted grid thumbnail, model name, status badge, cost, timestamp, reasoning indicator, token count
    - Clicking a row expands inline to show full `AnalysisResultCard` with detailed analysis
    - Lazy-loads full explanation data on first expand via `fetchExplanationById`
    - Supports scrolling through hundreds of explanations (no pagination)
  - **Architectural Notes**:
    - New page component with dedicated row component (`ExplanationGridRow`)
    - Reuses existing `TinyGrid`, `AnalysisResultCard`, and `usePaginatedExplanationSummaries` hook
    - SRP/DRY: Page handles layout; row handles single row rendering; data fetching via existing APIs
    - No model selection or prompt controls (read-only mode)
  - **Breaking Change**: All puzzle navigation links now point to `/task/:taskId` (new Puzzle Analyst) by default
    - PuzzleExaminer still accessible via direct URL `/puzzle/:taskId` if needed
    - Updated 10+ navigation components across the codebase
  - **Files Created**:

    - `client/src/pages/PuzzleBrowser.tsx` - Navigation route change
    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.9.22  Dec 21, 2025

- **Fix: Worm Arena context overflow for reasoning models** (Author: Claude Haiku 4.5)
  - **Problem**: OpenRouter models hitting 400k token context limit (461,156 tokens requested)
  - **Root Cause**: Reasoning models generate extremely verbose rationales (400k+ tokens), which get included in next turn's prompt, causing exponential growth per turn
  - **Solution**: Multi-layered approach:
    1. **OpenRouter middle-out transform**: Enables OpenRouter's automatic prompt compression feature (intelligently compresses prompts on their side)
    2. **Output token limits**: Set `max_output_tokens: 16000` for reasoning models to prevent explosive rationale generation
    3. **Rationale truncation**: Truncates rationales to 10,000 chars for prompts (80/20 split preserves context), but preserves full text in `move_history` for replay files
    4. **Prompt monitoring**: Warns when prompts exceed 100k tokens for early detection
  - **Impact**: Games that previously crashed mid-match with context errors will now complete successfully
  - **Data Preservation**: Full verbose rationales still saved to replay JSON files for post-game analysis
  - **Backwards Compatible**: All features opt-in/enabled by default, can be disabled via config
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `external/SnakeBench/backend/llm_providers.py` (lines 183-186, 222-225) - Added middle-out transform and output token limits
    - `external/SnakeBench/backend/players/llm_player.py` (lines 107-131, 163, 50-53) - Added truncation method and prompt monitoring
    - `external/SnakeBench/backend/players/llm_player_a.py` (lines 114-138, 171, 53-56) - Same changes for variant A player

### Version 6.9.21  Dec 20, 2025

- **Fix: OpenRouter Responses API max_output_tokens requirement** (Author: Claude Code)
  - **Issue**: OpenRouter updated Responses API proxy to require explicit `max_output_tokens` for reasoning models
  - **Symptom**: gpt-5.1-codex-mini returned empty `output=[]` array despite input being processed
  - **Root Cause**: `max_output_tokens` was never set in player config for OpenAI/xAI models
  - **Fix**: Added `config["max_output_tokens"] = 16000` for models starting with "openai/" or "x-ai/"
  - **Impact**: SnakeBench/Worm Arena matches with gpt-5.1-codex-mini will now generate output
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/python/snakebench_runner.py` (line 112)
    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.9.20  Dec 20, 2025

  - **Fallback**: Report still renders stats if the LLM summary fails
  - **Fix**: Summary request now matches Responses API input block format with instruction text and
    reasoning summary fallback parsing
  - **UI**: Inline summary block added to the Models page report card
  - **Docs**: Updated `docs/reference/data/WormArena_Model_Insights_Report.md`

### Version 6.9.18  Dec 20, 2025

- **SnakeBench: Add player variant system for A/B testing different LLM prompts** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Purpose**: Enable experimentation with different prompt strategies to improve LLM snake performance
  - **Architecture**: Modular registry pattern - add new variants by creating `llm_player_x.py` and registering in `variant_registry.py`
  - **New variant**: `LLMPlayerA` with tactical "cheat sheet" prompt featuring:
    - Structured decision checklist (safety-first elimination process)
    - Clearer turn context section
    - Same rules and output contract as baseline (verbatim)
  - **Status**: Variant support is present but currently **not enabled** in ARC Explainer runtime (baseline prompt remains in use)

    - `server/services/snakeBench/helpers/validators.ts` - (Dormant) no playerVariant fields in payload
    - `shared/types.ts` - (Dormant) no playerVariant fields in request types
  - **Extensibility**: To add variant B/C/D: create `llm_player_b.py`, add entry to `PLAYER_VARIANT_LOADERS` in registry

### Version 6.9.17  Dec 20, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Add Rules & LLM prompt transparency page + API endpoint** (Author: Cascade)
  - **New UI**: `/worm-arena/rules` page that shows:
    - Human-readable rules summary
    - Canonical TypeScript prompt template with placeholders (B2)
    - Live-extracted Python prompt builder block and raw source (B1)
  - **New public API**: `GET /api/snakebench/llm-player/prompt-template`
    - Returns both B1 and B2 representations so the UI is always truthful
    - Includes `APPLE_TARGET` parsed from SnakeBench Python constants when available
  - **Verification**: Added a drift-detection test that fails if the canonical fixed rules lines stop matching `llm_player.py`
  - **Files Created**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaRules.tsx`
    - `server/services/snakeBench/SnakeBenchLlmPlayerPromptTemplate.ts`
    - `tests/snakeBenchLlmPlayerPromptTemplate.test.ts`
  - **Files Modified**:

    - `shared/types.ts`

### Version 6.9.16  Dec 20, 2025

- **SnakeBench: Enable GitHub replay auto-publish workflow** (Author: Claude Haiku 4.5)
  - **Problem**: Replay publishing to GitHub was implemented but missing required environment variables, so games never pushed to VoynichLabs/SnakeBench repo
  - **Solution**: Added explicit environment variable configuration for GitHub publishing (token, owner, repo, branch, replay directory)
  - **Context**: Completed games are written locally to `external/SnakeBench/backend/completed_games_local`, then published to public `VoynichLabs/SnakeBench/backend/completed_games` via GitHub API for Railway and other deployments
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `.env` - Added `SNAKEBENCH_GITHUB_OWNER`, `SNAKEBENCH_GITHUB_REPO`, `SNAKEBENCH_GITHUB_BRANCH`, `SNAKEBENCH_GITHUB_REPLAY_DIR` configuration
    - `README.md` - Added 30-40 word explanation of replay publishing pipeline
  - **Going Forward**: All new games will auto-publish to GitHub; existing unpushed games from Dec 15-20 remain local

  - **API navigation**: Models page now includes one-click links to open:
    - `/api/snakebench/models-with-games`
    - `/api/snakebench/model-history-full?modelSlug=...`
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArena.tsx`

  - **Added**: Link to minireason symbolic reasoning benchmark (https://github.com/pwspen/minireason/tree/main)
  - **Context**: Simple, extensible symbolic reasoning benchmark with configurable difficulty knobs
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/browser/ReferenceMaterial.tsx` - Added minireason link alongside existing objarc entry in Tools & Solvers section

### Version 6.9.13  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Add Model Match History page** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4)
  - **Feature**: New `/worm-arena/models` page to browse every game a specific model has played
  - **Mirrors**: External SnakeBench `/models/[id]` page functionality
  - **Key behavior**: Model picker only lists models that have actually played games (no empty results)
  - **Backend**:
    - `GET /api/snakebench/models-with-games` - Returns only models with games played
    - `GET /api/snakebench/model-history-full?modelSlug=...` - Returns ALL matches (unbounded)
  - **Frontend**:
    - Model selector dropdown with games count and win rate
    - Stats header (total matches, win rate, rating, apples eaten, total cost)
    - Full match history table with opponent, date, duration, outcome, death reason, score, cost
    - Click opponent to switch to their match history
    - "View Replay" link to watch any game
  - **Files Created**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaModels.tsx` - Main page component
    - `client/src/hooks/useWormArenaModels.ts` - Data fetching hooks
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/repositories/SnakeBenchRepository.ts` - Added `getModelsWithGames()` and `getModelMatchHistoryUnbounded()`

### Version 6.9.12  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena Greatest Hits: Fix refresh and add dynamic ranking** (Author: Claude Haiku 4.5)
  - **Problem**: Greatest hits matches weren't refreshing with new interesting games; users saw stale curated list from Dec 11
  - **Solution**:
    1. Added 5 new dynamically-discovered high-interest games to curated hall of fame (Dec 18, 2025 matches)
    2. Implemented dynamic DB-driven ranking with graceful fallback to curated list
  - **New Games Added** (Dec 18, 2025):
    - `5a632478-e6c5-45df-9f6e-c5981f1eb66e` - Epic marathon duel (93/150 rounds, decisive 21-12 finish)
    - `d51f5e45-b148-4adc-b8e1-ab97ec34d8a0` - Highest-scoring match (23 apples with competitive 4-apple finish)
    - `fc95a52a-ecbb-4332-868f-e0810e3afd26` - Photo finish Gemini vs GPT-5.2 (21-20 with high cost signal ~$1.79)
    - `d24ac1c2-d4eb-42f8-8064-11dab8cc705a` - Kimi-K2 vs Gemini with extreme 3.7+ hour replay duration
    - `cdb63849-9ad8-48f0-8548-ae8fb4e80953` - Zero-cost duel (88 rounds, 18-16 apples)
  - **Architecture**: Service now tries dynamic DB ranking first via `SnakeBenchRepository.getWormArenaGreatestHits()`, falls back to curated list if DB unavailable
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/services/snakeBench/snakeBenchHallOfFame.ts` - Added 5 new games with meaningful highlight reasons
    - `server/services/snakeBench/helpers/replayFilters.ts` - Implemented two-tier strategy (dynamic DB + curated fallback)
  - **Verification**: Build and server startup successful; endpoint logic maintains backward compatibility

### Version 6.9.11  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Improve live board worm head visualization** (Author: Claude Haiku 4.5)
  - **Problem**: Live board always showed right arrow (➡️) for worm head, regardless of actual movement or lack of direction data
  - **Solution**: Updated head emoji logic to show direction arrows only before worm has body, then 🐛 once body grows
  - **Behavior**:
    - Just a head (no body): Directional arrows (⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️) based on movement
    - Has a body: Worm emoji (🐛) for clear worm identification
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/WormArenaGameBoard.tsx` - Updated `getHeadEmoji()` logic and call sites

### Version 6.9.10  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Fix suggested matchups refresh issue** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Problem**: Suggested matchups showed stale "unplayed pairing" results for days despite hundreds of matches played
  - **Root Cause**: Key normalization mismatch between database query and matchup suggestions logic
    - Database query uses `LEAST()`/`GREATEST()` functions with `:free` suffix removal
    - Matchup suggestions used simple alphabetical comparison without suffix removal
    - This created different keys for the same model pair, preventing proper filtering
  - **Fix**: Updated `pairKey()` function in `matchupSuggestions.ts` to match database normalization
  - **Additional**: Added `/api/snakebench/ingest-queue-status` endpoint for debugging queue delays
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/services/snakeBench/helpers/matchupSuggestions.ts` - fixed key normalization
    - `server/controllers/snakeBenchController.ts` - added ingest queue status endpoint
    - `server/routes.ts` - added route for ingest queue status
    - `client/src/hooks/useWormArenaSuggestMatchups.ts` - fixed useEffect dependency

### Version 6.9.9  Dec 19, 2025

- **SnakeBench Service: Complete modular refactoring** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Accomplishment**: Transformed monolithic 1687-line service into 14 focused modules
  - **Architecture**: Main `snakeBenchService.ts` now serves as thin orchestrator
  - **Benefits**: Improved maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns
  - **Preservation**: All 19 public methods maintain identical signatures and behavior
  - **Quality**: Comprehensive headers, JSDoc, and comments throughout all modules
  - **Status**: Code refactoring complete, testing and deployment pending
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts` - rewritten as orchestrator
    - `server/services/snakeBench/` - 14 new focused modules created
  - **Documentation**: See `docs/2025-12-19-snakebench-service-refactor.md` for full details

### Version 6.9.8  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Simplify replay loading - server always returns data directly** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4)
  - **Problem**: Complex client-side URL fetching with CORS fallbacks was unreliable
  - **Solution**: Server now ALWAYS fetches replay data server-side and returns `{data}` directly
    - Matches how the Python SnakeBench project serves replays - simple and direct
    - No more client-side URL fetching or CORS issues
  - **Resolution order in getGame()**:
    1. Local file from database replay_path
    2. Local file at standard path (completed_games/snake_game_<id>.json)
    3. Remote URL from database replay_path (fetched server-side)
    4. Railway backend fallback (fetched server-side)
    5. GitHub raw fallback (fetched server-side)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts` - getGame() always fetches server-side
    - `server/controllers/snakeBenchController.ts` - simplified response format
    - `client/src/hooks/useSnakeBench.ts` - removed complex fallback logic
  - **Note**: VoynichLabs/SnakeBench is our fork with 1244 replay JSONs committed

### Version 6.9.7  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Fix replay existence check to accept HTTP URLs from database** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4)
  - **Root Cause**: Commit `c3b3379a` broke replays by "simplifying" `replayExists()` to ignore HTTP URLs
    - The bug was line: `if (dbReplay?.replayPath && !dbReplay.replayPath.startsWith('http'))`
    - This explicitly skipped all remote replay URLs stored in the DB
    - Games with remote replays (most of them) were filtered out as "non-existent"
  - **Fix**: `replayExists()` now returns `true` for HTTP/HTTPS URLs in the DB
    - `getGame()` already had proper logic to fetch remote URLs
    - The mismatch meant `replayExists()` said "no replay" but `getGame()` could load it fine
  - **Files Modified**: `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts`
  - **Impact**: Greatest Hits and replay filtering now correctly include games with remote replay URLs

### Version 6.9.6  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Fix replay loading to use Greg's Railway backend (root cause fix)** (Author: Claude Sonnet 4)
  - **Root Cause**: Previous code used wrong/stale upstream URL for fetching replays from upstream SnakeBench
    - Was trying: `snakebench.com/api/matches/{id}` (frontend domain, not backend)
    - Should use: `backend-production-fc22.up.railway.app/api/matches/{id}` (Greg's actual Railway backend)
  - **Architecture clarification**: Greg uses Next.js SSR - his server fetches from Supabase Storage and embeds 
    data in HTML. Browser sees no Supabase requests because they happen server-side. Our backend-to-backend 
    approach (fetching from his Flask API) is correct and equivalent.
  - **Fix**: Updated `snakeBenchService.getGame()` and `getGameProxy()` to use Greg's Railway backend directly
    - Primary fallback: `https://backend-production-fc22.up.railway.app/api/matches/{gameId}`
    - Secondary fallback: GitHub raw for older games
  - **New env var**: `SNAKEBENCH_UPSTREAM_BACKEND_URL` - override Greg's backend URL if it changes
    - Default: `https://backend-production-fc22.up.railway.app`
  - **Fallback order**: Local file -> DB replay_path -> Greg's Railway backend -> GitHub raw
  - **Files Modified**: `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts`

### Version 6.9.5  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Restore fallback when greatest hits unavailable + simplify replay loading** (Author: Claude Haiku 4.5)
  - **UI Fix**: Fixed regression from v6.9.3 where replays appeared broken due to blank page when greatest-hits endpoint returns empty
    - Restored cascade logic: prefer greatest hits → fall back to recent games (filtered by ≥20 rounds) → show any recent game
    - Dependency array now includes `games` so fallback logic re-evaluates when recent games load
  - **Backend Fix**: Simplified `replayExists()` to check local bundled files only
    - Removed slow remote URL fallbacks (GitHub raw, snakebench.com) that were timing out
    - All replay JSONs are bundled in `external/SnakeBench/backend/completed_games/` and deployed to Railway
    - Direct `fs.existsSync()` check is fast, reliable, and works in both dev and production
    - Removed unnecessary `SNAKEBENCH_REPLAY_RAW_BASE` env var dependency (optional in .env)
  - **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/WormArena.tsx`, `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts`
  - **Impact**: Greatest hits now always return playable games (fast local checks) + page shows fallback replays if needed

### Version 6.9.4  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena Console & Model Selector UI Refinement** (Author: Claude Haiku 4.5)
  - Reduced excessive padding in model selector list for more compact, terminal-like appearance
  - Changed model selector buttons from `px-3 py-2` to `px-2 py-1` with reduced text sizes (`text-xs`)
  - Replaced row spacing (`space-y-2`) with subtle `border-b` dividers for cleaner look
  - Moved win/loss/tie stats inline with model name instead of right-aligned (like trading terminal ticker)
  - Changed console view layout from stacked (vertical) to side-by-side (horizontal)
  - Python ASCII console now on left, event stream on right with equal horizontal space
  - Reduced event stream text sizes and padding for denser display
  - Improved space efficiency on live match pages by eliminating whitespace
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/wormArena/stats/WormArenaModelListCard.tsx`
    - `client/src/components/WormArenaConsoleMirror.tsx`

### Version 6.9.3  Dec 19, 2025 14:30 

- **Worm Arena: Default to greatest hits match on page load** (Author: Cascade)
  - Fixed blank screen issue on `/worm-arena` by defaulting to load the first greatest hits match instead of showing no content
  - Added `useWormArenaGreatestHits` hook usage to main WormArena component
  - Changed default selection logic from recent games to curated greatest hits games
  - Users now see an interesting match immediately instead of a blank page
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArena.tsx`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.9.2  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Free model preference and normalization** (Author: Cascade)
  - Fixed issue where free and paid versions of same model (e.g., `mistralai/devstral-2512` vs `mistralai/devstral-2512:free`) were treated as separate models
  - Modified pairing history query to normalize model slugs by removing `:free` suffix
  - Updated suggest-matchups logic to prefer free versions over paid versions when both exist
  - Fixed model rating lookups (`/api/snakebench/model-rating`) to return data for free/paid variants
  - Fixed model history lookups (`/api/snakebench/model-history`) to include matches for both variants
  - Fixed match filtering (`/api/snakebench/matches`) to include results for free/paid variants
  - Fixed TrueSkill leaderboards (`/api/snakebench/leaderboard`) to group by normalized slugs instead of showing duplicates
  - Fixed basic leaderboards (`/api/snakebench/leaderboard/basic`) to group by normalized slugs instead of showing duplicates
  - Ensures free models appear in suggestions instead of paid equivalents
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/repositories/SnakeBenchRepository.ts`
    - `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.9.1  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Persistent live-link resolution** (Author: Cascade)
  - Fixed issue where old `/worm-arena/live/:sessionId` links would show "Session unavailable" after server restarts
  - Added `worm_arena_sessions` Postgres table to persist `sessionId -> gameId` mappings
  - Old live links now reliably redirect to exact replays even after server restarts
  - Added `WormArenaSessionRepository` for DB operations
  - Updated `wormArenaStreamController` to persist completed sessions to DB
  - **New files created**:
    - `server/repositories/WormArenaSessionRepository.ts`
    - `migrations/0005_worm-arena-sessions.sql`
    - `docs/plans/2025-12-19-worm-arena-persistent-live-links.md`

    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.8.2  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Replay viewer reliability fix (CORS-proof replay loading)** (Author: Cascade)
  - Fixed replay loading failures where the browser attempted to fetch remote replay JSON directly (often blocked by CORS)
  - Server now fetches remote replay JSON (DB replay_path, snakebench.com upstream, GitHub raw fallback) and returns it as same-origin `{ data }`
  - Restores replay viewing (including Console View) in both local dev and production
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.8.1  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Production crash fix + friendlier live link handling** (Author: Cascade)
  - Fixed a **blank page crash** in Worm Arena Matches caused by an invalid Radix Select item (`SelectItem value=""`)
    - Replaced empty-string select values with a non-empty sentinel and mapped it back to “no filter” internally
  - Improved **Live link UX** when a sessionId is expired/unknown in production
    - Added a preflight gate using `/api/wormarena/resolve/:sessionId` before attempting SSE connect
    - If the match already finished, users are redirected to the replay automatically
    - If the link is expired/unknown, the page stays usable with a clear message (no hard crash)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaMatches.tsx`
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaLive.tsx`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.7.0  Dec 18, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Major UX improvements across all pages** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Compact headers everywhere**: All Worm Arena pages now use compact header mode (~1/3 original size)
    - Title + nav pills inline on single row

- **Worm Arena: Upstream replay URL pattern with snakebench.com fallback** (Author: Cascade)
  - Changed `GET /api/snakebench/games/:gameId` to match upstream SnakeBench pattern:
    - Returns `{ data }` when local file available (local dev)
    - Returns `{ replayUrl, fallbackUrls }` when replay must be fetched remotely (deployment)
  - **Fallback URL chain** (client tries in order until one succeeds):
    1. DB `replay_path` URL (if stored)
    2. `https://snakebench.com/api/matches/<id>` (upstream site, for old games)
    3. GitHub raw (`VoynichLabs/SnakeBench/main/backend/completed_games/`)
  - Frontend `useSnakeBenchGame` hook now tries multiple URLs until one succeeds
  - **This eliminates server-side JSON proxy truncation issues** that caused "Invalid JSON response" errors in Railway deployment

### Version 6.6.3  Dec 18, 2025

- **Worm Arena: Deployment replay fallback fix** (Author: Cascade)
  - Updated `GET /api/snakebench/games/:gameId` replay loading so a bad/unreadable local replay file no longer blocks fallback to remote replay sources (DB URL and GitHub raw).

### Version 6.5.7  Dec 19, 2025

- **Worm Arena Live: restore tall reasoning columns + reinstated stats strip + clearer reconnect errors** (Author: Codex (GPT-5))
  - Reasoning columns are tall again (≈46rem) with scrollable bodies so the layout matches the live board height, while the top apple scoreboard is now about half its previous height.
  - The under-board status strip brings back the round/score/alive grid and shows session IDs plus live phase, so users still see the classic streaming telemetry beneath the board.
  - If a user opens `/worm-arena/live/:sessionId` after the single-use session handshake expires, the page now stays in “live” mode and explains that current sessions cannot be rejoined mid-match.

  - TrueSkill leaderboard now supports sticky headers reliably and allows row-click selection to set the baseline (highlighted selection).
  - Hero graphic now uses Worm Arena typography, shows a clear "Model Snapshot [model]" heading, adds Games/Wins/Losses/Ties/Cost stat boxes, and tightens the x-axis bounds to roughly align with the 99.7% interval story.

- **Gemini 3 Flash Preview routing parity** (Author: Codex)
  - Added the native `gemini-3-flash-preview` key to the Gemini service map and primary model catalog so the low-latency thinking tier is exposed to prompt selection and analytics.
  - Mirrored the slug across the shared model list, OpenRouter builder, and catalog (plus metadata) so BYO paths can reach the same fast reasoning model with up-to-date context/pricing data.

### Version 6.5.0  Dec 17, 2025

- **Worm Arena Skill Analysis: baseline picker + layout refresh** (Author: Cascade)
  - The reference model slug in the top-right snapshot is now a button: click it to clear the baseline and re-open the baseline model picker list (sorted by games played).
  - Widened the Skill Analysis layout so the left-side Models list card has enough room and no longer looks clipped.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/wormArena/stats/WormArenaModelSnapshotCard.tsx`
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaSkillAnalysis.tsx`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.4.11  Dec 17, 2025

- **Worm Arena Skill Analysis: bell curve chart containment + layout fixes (match reference)** (Author: Cascade)
  - Bell curve SVG now reserves top/bottom margins so curves, labels, and axis ticks stay inside the poster.
  - Uses a wider ±4σ range and stable integer axis bounds so tails taper naturally instead of feeling clipped.
  - Adds a dashed vertical line at the selected model's μ and offsets labels to avoid overlap when models are close.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/components/wormArena/stats/WormArenaSkillHeroGraphic.tsx`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.4.10  Dec 17, 2025

- **Worm Arena Skill Analysis: include ALL games (stop filtering by game_type) so model graph populates** (Author: Cascade)
  - Fixes the Skill Analysis page appearing empty when replays are labeled `ladder` (or other upstream types).
  - SnakeBench analytics queries (stats/TrueSkill leaderboard/model rating) now count all games, regardless of `public.games.game_type`.
  - Replay ingest supports a `gameTypeOverride` so ARC Explainer can standardize the stored `game_type` going forward.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `server/repositories/SnakeBenchRepository.ts`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.4.9  Dec 17, 2025

- **Worm Arena Skill Analysis: reuse Stats & Placement components (global stats, leaderboard, reference placement)** (Author: Cascade)
  - Skill Analysis page now reuses the same shared stats modules as the Stats & Placement page:
    - Adds `WormArenaGlobalStatsStrip` and `WormArenaTrueSkillLeaderboard` above the existing 3-column skill analysis layout.
    - When a reference model is selected, the right column now shows `WormArenaPlacementCard` beneath the reference snapshot.
  - Fixes Skill Analysis header total games to use global stats instead of a hardcoded `0`.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaSkillAnalysis.tsx`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.4.8  Dec 17, 2025

- **Worm Arena Skill Analysis: unified hero graphic matching TikZ reference design** (Author: Cascade)
  - Created `WormArenaSkillHeroGraphic.tsx` — a single unified "poster" component that draws:
    - Top row: "Skill estimate μ" and "Uncertainty σ" headers with large blue pills and descriptive text
    - Middle: "99.7% Confidence Interval" with red (pessimistic) and green (optimistic) pills connected by a dash, plus explanatory KaTeX formula
    - Bottom: Overlapping SVG bell curves — gray filled reference curve behind, blue filled current curve in front, with model labels positioned above peaks
  - Removed separate `WormArenaSkillMetrics` and `WormArenaSkillDistributionChart` from center column.
  - Center column is now borderless (no Card chrome) — reads as one clean poster graphic.
  - Typography uses Georgia serif for headers matching the reference.
  - **Files Created**:
    - `client/src/components/wormArena/stats/WormArenaSkillHeroGraphic.tsx`
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaSkillAnalysis.tsx`

### Version 6.4.7  Dec 17, 2025

- **Worm Arena Skill Analysis: finished wiring + chart polish (URL selection, KaTeX math, visible axis/ticks)** (Author: Cascade)
  - Skill Analysis page (`/worm-arena/skill-analysis`) now drives selected model + reference model via URL query params (`?model=...&reference=...`).
  - Ratings on the Skill Analysis page now reliably load by explicitly calling `useModelRating().refresh()` when selection changes.
  - KaTeX math rendering (`InlineMath`) is used consistently for μ/σ/± copy, with KaTeX CSS loaded on the page.
  - Bell curve chart no longer clips tick labels; adds axis label and displays hover readout as density (not a misleading percent).
  - Worm Arena navigation now includes a "Skill Analysis" tab on Replay/Live/Matches/Stats pages.
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `client/src/pages/WormArenaSkillAnalysis.tsx`

### Version 6.4.6  Dec 17, 2025

- **HuggingFace union accuracy SRP/DRY refactor (shared compare service + auto-fetch hook + shared union UI)** (Author: Cascade)
  - `/scoring` refactored from a 1000+ line page into a small orchestration component composed of focused sections.
  - Introduced a shared `/api/metrics/compare` client service to centralize request-building, fetch, and error parsing.
  - Added a dedicated `useAttemptUnionComparison` hook using `@tanstack/react-query` so `/scoring` auto-fetches on dataset/model pair change.
  - Extracted `AttemptUnionCard` into a shared component and added a `variant` to preserve both dialog and `/scoring` presentations.
  - Centralized dataset display-name mapping into `client/src/constants/datasets.ts` and updated consumers.
  - **Files Created**:
    - `client/src/services/metrics/compareService.ts`

### Version 6.4.5  Dec 16, 2025

- **Union accuracy UI: stable denominators for “Puzzles solved” and “Test pairs”** (Author: Cascade)
  - `/scoring` and related comparison UIs now use dataset-level totals (total puzzles and total test pairs) as denominators.
  - Fixes confusing displays like `1 of 1 fully correct` by showing `… of 120` for ARC2-Eval, and `… of <all test pairs>`.
  - Dataset totals are computed once (cached in-memory) from the dataset JSON files.
  - **Files Modified**: `server/repositories/ModelDatasetRepository.ts`, `server/repositories/MetricsRepository.ts`, `client/src/pages/HuggingFaceUnionAccuracy.tsx`, `client/src/pages/ModelComparisonPage.tsx`, `client/src/components/analytics/ModelComparisonDialog.tsx`, `client/src/pages/AnalyticsOverview.tsx`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.4.4  Dec 16, 2025

- **Worm Arena Live: model dropdowns sort newest-first (DB discovered_at + releaseDate fallback)** (Author: Cascade)
  - Live match setup model dropdowns now prefer models we most recently added/discovered (SnakeBench DB `discovered_at`), then fall back to `releaseDate`, then A–Z.
  - Prevents the Live setup panel from overriding the intended ordering by re-sorting everything alphabetically.
  - **Files Modified**: `server/repositories/SnakeBenchRepository.ts`, `server/routes/models.ts`, `client/src/pages/WormArenaLive.tsx`, `client/src/components/WormArenaRunControls.tsx`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.4.3  Dec 16, 2025

- **/scoring: add explicit union scoring explanation (task/puzzle/test-pair definitions + worked examples)** (Author: Cascade)
  - Replaced the minimal "Understanding the three metrics" blurb with a detailed, union-centric explanation.
  - Clearly defines: puzzle vs task (same thing), training pairs vs test pairs, and how the two-attempt union rule works.
  - Adds a worked 3-test-pair example showing Attempt 1, Attempt 2, and the union result per pair.
  - Adds a concrete example explaining why the official harness score (average of puzzle scores) can differ from the pair-weighted test-pairs rate (e.g., 117/166).
  - Progress bar label now explicitly states it reflects the pair-weighted rate.
  - **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/HuggingFaceUnionAccuracy.tsx`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.4.2  Dec 16, 2025

- **Build reliability: OpenRouter catalog sync now merges remote into local snapshot** (Author: Cascade)
  - Prevents deploy failures when OpenRouter temporarily omits a model ID that is already referenced by our `OPENROUTER_MODEL_KEYS`.
  - Sync is now best-effort: if OpenRouter fetch fails, the build keeps the existing local catalog snapshot instead of overwriting it.
  - **Files Modified**: `server/scripts/sync-openrouter-catalog.ts`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.4.1  Dec 16, 2025

- **Build fix: Missing closing brace in adminController.ts** (Author: Cascade)
  - Fixed syntax error at line 746 where `syncOpenRouterConfig` function was missing closing brace.
  - **Files Modified**: `server/controllers/adminController.ts`

### Version 6.4.0  Dec 16, 2025

- **ARC-AGI multi-test-pair scoring: harness-aligned accuracy + clearer UI metrics** (Author: Cascade)
  - **Critical scoring fix**: dataset score is the average of per-puzzle scores (each puzzle weighted equally), not a pair-weighted ratio.
  - **Backend**:
    - Added public `GET /api/accuracy/harness` endpoint returning harness-aligned accuracy for `{baseModelName}-attempt1/-attempt2`.
    - Added `AccuracyRepository.getHarnessAlignedAccuracyStats()` returning both harness score and pair-weighted transparency metrics.
    - Added pure scoring utilities `server/utils/harnessScoring.ts` to keep math testable and DRY.
    - Extended `MetricsRepository.computeAttemptUnionStats()` to return `puzzlesCounted`, `puzzlesFullySolved`, and `puzzlesFullySolvedIds`.
  - **Database**:
    - Added `num_test_pairs` column (plus index + backfill) to support multi-test-pair scoring and aggregation.
    - Updated `ExplanationRepository.saveExplanation()` to persist `num_test_pairs` on insert.
  - **Frontend**:
    - Removed client-side attempt-union scoring fallback (cannot compute harness score without per-pair data).
    - All three metrics now displayed side-by-side: **Harness Score** (official), **Puzzles Solved** (fully correct), **Test Pairs** (pair-weighted).
    - Three-metric grid layout on `/scoring`, `ModelComparisonPage`, and `ModelComparisonDialog`.
    - Added `computePuzzlePassFailRate()` helper in `modelComparison.ts` for puzzle-level pass/fail rate.
  - **Documentation Audit**:
    - Updated `AccuracyRepository` header to clarify two accuracy concepts (puzzle-level vs harness-aligned).
    - Updated `AccuracyLeaderboard` and `Leaderboards` descriptions to clarify puzzle-level accuracy is NOT harness score.
  - **Tests**:
    - Added unit tests demonstrating harness score differs from pair-weighted accuracy when puzzles have different numbers of test pairs.
    - Added controller test for `GET /api/accuracy/harness` input validation + delegation.
  - **Files Created**: `server/controllers/accuracyController.ts`, `server/utils/harnessScoring.ts`, `tests/harnessScoring.test.ts`, `tests/accuracyHarnessEndpoint.test.ts`

### Version 6.3.2  Dec 16, 2025 (PENDING TESTING)

- **SnakeBench: prevent local replays from blocking pulls** (Author: Cascade)
  - Local SnakeBench runs now write replay JSONs to `external/SnakeBench/backend/completed_games_local/` by default (configurable via `SNAKEBENCH_COMPLETED_GAMES_DIR`).
  - This prevents untracked local replay files from colliding with tracked files under `external/SnakeBench/backend/completed_games/` and breaking `git pull`.
  - Local video tooling now defaults to `external/SnakeBench/backend/completed_games_videos_local/` (also aligned with `SNAKEBENCH_COMPLETED_GAMES_DIR`).
  - **Files Modified**: `external/SnakeBench/backend/main.py`, `external/SnakeBench/backend/app.py`, `external/SnakeBench/backend/services/video_generator.py`, `external/SnakeBench/backend/cli/analyze_local_games.py`, `external/SnakeBench/backend/cli/generate_video.py`, `external/SnakeBench/backend/cli/generate_videos_local.py`, `external/SnakeBench/backend/cli/backfill_videos.py`, `external/SnakeBench/backend/tests/test_main.py`, `external/SnakeBench/backend/generate_videos.sh`, `external/SnakeBench/.gitignore`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.3.1  Dec 16, 2025 (PENDING TESTING)

- **Johan_Land community solver visibility + cost metrics on all comparison pages** (Author: Claude Code using Sonnet 4.5)
  - **Johan_Land Integration**: Johan_Land community solver results now visible across all model comparison pages (/scoring, /analytics, /model-comparison)
  - **Cost Metrics Display**: Added comprehensive cost and performance metrics to /scoring page showing total cost, cost per puzzle, cost per correct answer, and average processing time
  - **Model Origin Detection**: Created centralized `modelOriginDetection.ts` utility to distinguish between HuggingFace official, community solvers, and ARC Explainer platform results
  - **Origin Badges**: Added visual badges across all pages to clearly identify data source (HF Official, Community, Platform)
  - **Page Scope Update**: Renamed /scoring page from "Official Scoring" to "Multi-Attempt Solver Results" to reflect inclusion of community-submitted evaluations
  - **DRY Compliance**: Eliminated duplicate origin detection logic across pages by centralizing in shared utility
  - **Files Created**: `client/src/utils/modelOriginDetection.ts`
  - **Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/HuggingFaceUnionAccuracy.tsx` (cost metrics, title, badges), `client/src/pages/AnalyticsOverview.tsx` (utility integration), `client/src/pages/ModelComparisonPage.tsx` (origin badges), `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.2.2  Dec 16, 2025 (PENDING TESTING)

- **Worm Arena: align replay score text with player palettes** (Author: Codex (GPT-5))

  - Keeps the visual language consistent during replay streaming by using the palette tokens already defined in `client/src/index.css`.
  - **Files Modified**: `client/src/components/WormArenaControlBar.tsx`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.2.1  Dec 16, 2025 (PENDING TESTING)

- **Worm Arena: Greatest Hits #1 marathon + reliable replay links + show more entries** (Author: Cascade)
  - Promoted the marathon replay `97c1dad4-3905-4d29-a781-f7a9691f063d` to the top of the curated Worm Arena Hall of Fame.
  - Greatest-hits endpoint now scans the curated list until it finds the requested number of playable replays (so missing early replays no longer shrink the list).
  - Greatest Hits UI now uses client-side navigation and normalizes `snake_game_*.json` style IDs before linking to `/worm-arena?matchId=...`.
  - **Files Modified**: `server/services/snakeBenchHallOfFame.ts`, `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts`, `client/src/components/WormArenaGreatestHits.tsx`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.3.0  Dec 16, 2025 (COMPLETED)

- **Johan_Land_Solver_V6 scoring: pair-aware ingestion + harness-aligned union accuracy** (Author: Cascade, Validation & Execution: Claude Code)
  - **Critical Fix**: Resolved fundamental data structure misunderstanding. Submission JSON is array of test pairs (not single puzzle with 2 attempts).
  - **Ingestion Logic**: Iterates through submission array; each element = one test pair with attempt_1 and attempt_2 solving the same pair_index.
  - **Per-Pair Validation**: Each attempt validated against `task.test[pair_index].output` (ground truth), not against solver's own `correct` flag.
  - **Union Scoring**: If ANY attempt solves a pair, that pair counts as solved (matches official ARC-AGI benchmarking harness).
  - **Backend Accuracy**: Changed from global averaging to per-puzzle averaging: `(sum of per-puzzle fractions) / num_puzzles * 100`.
  - **Validation Result**: Harness-style score 71.29% (84.83/119 tasks) matches DB/UI union score 71.29% (117/166 test pairs)
  - **Re-ingestion**: All 238 entries (119 puzzles × 2 attempts) successfully re-ingested with corrected pair-aware logic.
  - **Files Modified**: `server/scripts/ingest-johanland-results.ts`, `server/repositories/MetricsRepository.ts`, `server/types/johanland.ts`, `CHANGELOG.md`

  - Fixed snake head arrow orientation so vertical movement is no longer inverted.
  - ASCII replay preview now matches the engine coordinate orientation.
  - **Files Modified**: `client/src/components/WormArenaGameBoard.tsx`, `client/src/components/WormArenaGameBoardSVG.tsx`, `client/src/pages/WormArena.tsx`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.1.63  Dec 16, 2025 (PENDING TESTING)

- **Johan_Land scoring: harness-aligned correctness + union aggregation** (Author: Cascade)
  - Ingestion now recomputes correctness against ground truth per test pair (treats `attempt.correct` as untrusted).
  - Ingestion stores one row per puzzle per attempt using `multi_test_*` fields so multi-pair puzzles are preserved.
  - Attempt union accuracy now matches ARC harness aggregation (average of per-task fractions).
  - **Files Modified**: `server/scripts/ingest-johanland-results.ts`, `server/repositories/MetricsRepository.ts`, `server/types/johanland.ts`, `CHANGELOG.md`

  - After publish, the DB `public.games.replay_path` is updated to the GitHub raw URL.
  - GitHub raw replay fetch 404s are now logged as warnings (expected for older/unpublished games).
  - **Files Modified**: `server/services/snakeBenchIngestQueue.ts`, `server/services/snakeBenchGitHubPublisher.ts` (new), `server/repositories/SnakeBenchRepository.ts`, `server/services/snakeBenchService.ts`, `CHANGELOG.md`

- **Worm Arena: enable Nemotron 3 Nano 30B and add tournament script** (Author: Codex GPT-5)
  - Added `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free` to the server-side OpenRouter allowlist so SnakeBench can actually run matches with it.
  - Updated the local OpenRouter catalog snapshot to include the model metadata (context, pricing, supported parameters).
  - Added a PowerShell tournament script that queues matches against the current top TrueSkill leaderboard models.
  - **Files Modified**: `server/config/openrouterModels.ts`, `server/config/openrouter-catalog.json`, `scripts/worm-arena-tournaments/nemotron3-nano-30b-vs-top-leaderboard.ps1`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.1.61  Dec 15, 2025 (PENDING TESTING)

- **Worm Arena: show DB-imported OpenRouter models automatically** (Author: Codex GPT-5)
  - Models returned by `GET /api/models` now include active OpenRouter slugs imported via the Admin UI (SnakeBench DB), so Worm Arena dropdowns reflect imports without editing config files.
  - Admin OpenRouter page copy now clarifies that "Import" updates the DB roster used by Worm Arena, while "Sync to Config" is optional metadata curation.
  - **Files Modified**: `server/routes/models.ts`, `client/src/pages/AdminOpenRouter.tsx`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Version 6.1.60  Dec 15, 2025 (PENDING TESTING)

### Version 6.1.59  Dec 15, 2025 (PENDING TESTING)

- **Johan_Land ingestion: correct multi-test validation + schema-aligned storage** (Author: Cascade)
  - Fixed Johan_Land ingestion to validate puzzles with multiple test cases using `validateSolverResponseMulti` and store:
    - `multiplePredictedOutputs`
    - `multiTestPredictionGrids`
    - `multiTestResults`
