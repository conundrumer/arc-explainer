/**
 * Author: Gemini 3 Flash High
 * Date: 2025-12-27
 * PURPOSE: Source-of-truth plumbing for exposing the Worm Arena (SnakeBench) LLM player prompt.
 *          Provides two complementary representations:
 *          - B1 (live): Read the upstream Python source file (external/SnakeBench/backend/players/llm_player.py)
 *            and extract the prompt builder block for display.
 *          - B2 (canonical): A TypeScript-maintained, human-readable prompt template with explicit placeholders.
 *
 *          This is used by:
 *          - Public API endpoint: GET /api/snakebench/llm-player/prompt-template
 *          - Frontend: /worm-arena/rules
 *
 * SRP/DRY check: Pass - focused on prompt template retrieval/verification helpers only.
